Using Machine Learning to predict rating of an unreleased movie, ultimately, it's success. 🎥
### *<ins>Machine Learning</ins>*
* Learning is any process by which a system improves performance from experience.

* Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that automatically improve their performance	through experience. 🤖

* The core insight of machine learning is that much of what we recognize as intelligence hinges on probability rather than reason or logic.

### *<ins>Coming to our project</ins>*
* The worldwide Box ofﬁce revenue 2016 was 38.3 billion USD with hundreds of new movies made each year. 🎬

* If one can use a computer to predict how successful a movie will be even before it is released, this would be a powerful tool to use. An aspiring Hollywood director or a movie studio with some technical skills could predict whether their movie idea is going to be a safe investment. 🍿
 
* With the vast amount of data published on the Internet and the increasing power of the modern computer, is it possible to take advantage of these resources to make predictions? 🎦

### *<ins>And this is how I ended up with these questions</ins>*
* Is it possible to use machine learning algorithms to predict if movie will receive a high or low rating? 🙋🏻‍♂️

* Is the available data online viable for use in predicting movie success? 🙋🏻

* Is there a correlation between attributes and success of a movie? 🙋
